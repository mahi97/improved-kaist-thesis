    %Over the past decade, carbon nanotubes have emerged as one of the ideal basic materials
    %in the emerging nanotechnology field due to their unique electrical and mechanical properties.
    %Depending on the detailed method of wrapping graphite, their electrical properties vary
    %widely from metallic to semiconducting with a band gap of 1 eV.
    %This thesis examines various physical properties of carbon nanotubes,
    %primarily using first-principles density functional theory and the tight-binding approximation model,
    %addressing electrical properties and their control methods, magnetic properties, and transport characteristics.
